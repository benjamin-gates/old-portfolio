        <h3> About Me </h3>
        <section>
          <p> My passion for web development started when I was a math major in college. I had several classes that required me to solve applied math problems by coding a solution into the computer. Through these classes, I learned several important points: </p>               
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Working with others</strong> is key to gaining/growing knowledge and ideas.</li>
            <li>Being patient and having a "get-at-it" attitude will always benefit you in the end </li>
          </ul>
        </section>

          <p>Despite my strong passion for web development, especially in the <strong>educational field</strong>, I also have other interests. These interests are listed in order as follows: </p>
          <ol>
            <li>Running (I have run 2 marathons in my life), </li>
            <li>Hiking/Camping outdoors,</li>
            <li>Finding new and creative ways to <em>present learning material</em>, and...</li>
            <li>Spending time with family.</li>
