        <h3> About Me </h3>
        <p> My passion for web development started when I was a math major in college. I had several classes that required me to solve applied math problems by coding a solution into the computer. Through these classes, I learned several important points: </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Working with others</strong> is key to gaining/growing knowledge and ideas.</li>
          <li>Being patient and having a "get-at-it" attitude will always benefit you in the end </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Despite my strong passion for web development, especially in the <strong>educational field</strong>, I also have other interests. These interests are listed in order as follows: </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Running (I have run 2 marathons in my life),<img src="images/marathon.jpg"/></li>
          <li>Hiking/Camping outdoors,</li>
          <li>Finding new and creative ways to <em>present learning material</em>, and...</li>
          <li>Walking my dog.<img src="images/dog.jpg"/</li>
